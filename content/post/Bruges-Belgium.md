Bruges, or alternatively Brügge(German), or Brugge (Dutch), is a lovely city in Belgium near the coast that has been a tourist destination for over a hundred years now.  Even with that in mind, it's worth a visit of 2 to 3 days.

First off, before you go: Watch "In Bruges".  Very funny dark movie, takes place almost entirely in Bruges and is probably singlehandedly for about 20% of the tourists. :)

## Where to stay

I've only stayed at two hotels in Bruges and there are many fine ones, along with plenty of AirBnB opportunities.  
* Hotel Oude

## Food and drink

Two of my favorite dishes in Bruges are Carbonade flamande (a delicious meat stew) and Croquettes, my wife, Laurie, is a big fan of Moules-frites.   While Belgium is known for it's frites, and there is a "Frites Museum" in town, I haven't found any place worth recommending.

But, you must get some Waffles at some point in your voyage.
 
 
The restaurant/bar Cambrinus has a literal book full of beers to drink.   Food is ok, but nothing to write home about.
